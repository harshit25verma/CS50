The average of valence, energy and dancebility might not be accurate representation of someone's aura as the moods of people are always changing on the basis of environment, their personal health and current affairs in their lives. There can also be a misjudgment in terms of songs as some songs with low tempo can have higher valency, but some songs with higher tempo can have lower valency and danceability, just like some particular EDMs, or Some high energy songs with high danceability can have less valency such some songs from the Weeknd. Al this discrepencies lead to this method not being an accurate measure of someone's aura throughout a whole year.
